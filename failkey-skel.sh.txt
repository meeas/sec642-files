# This script iterates through all the possible key values for the FailPics site,
# generating a hash from the combination of the "q" parameter (SQL query) and the
# key guess.  The output hash can then be compared to the hash from the URL
# parameter "md5", e.x.
# ./failkey.sh >hashes

HASH="FILLMEIN"

# Iterate through all the possible values used to derive the key
for year in `seq -w my1975 2025`; do
    for ... # Add another FOR loop for the month
        for ... # Add another FOR loop for the day
            # 1. Calculate the guess key by MD5 hashing the year/month/day

			# 2. Calculate the hash guess by combining the query parameter with
            #    the key guess, then hashing the two

            # 3. Print the key guess and hash to the output so we can
            #    redirect it to a file and search the keys with grep.

            # NOTES:
            #
            # Make sure to use "echo -n" to remove the newline before hashing!
            # The md5sum tool outputs the hash followed by "  -"; we strip that with sed
